# eve-dogma request/response contract (v1, revision 1.4.5)

Stateless: **one JSON `FitRequest` in → one JSON `FitStats` out.** No hidden state, no clocks, no network.
The same request with the same dataset must give byte-identical output. Unknown request fields are ignored.
Breaking changes bump `schema_version` and are listed in the changelog at the end of this file.

## Process interface (CLI)

| Mode | Command | I/O |
|---|---|---|
| single | `eve-dogma calc [FILE]` | FitRequest JSON on stdin (or FILE) → FitStats JSON on stdout, exit 0. On a calc error the `{"error":…}` JSON is still written to stdout and the exit code is 2 |
| batch | `eve-dogma batch` | one FitRequest per line (JSONL) on stdin → one FitStats per line, same order; a failing line yields its `{"error":…}` line in place, exit 0 |
| rpc | `eve-dogma serve-stdio` | JSONL `{"id","method","params"}` → `{"id","result"}`; methods `calc`, `eft_parse` (`{text}`), `eft_export` (`{fit,name?}`), `search` (`{query,limit?,kinds?}`), `type` (`{id}` id or name), `meta` |
| helpers | `eft FILE [--calc] [--skills N]`, `search Q`, `type ID|NAME`, `meta`, `bench FILE -n N` | |

Dataset: `--dataset PATH`, else `$EVE_DOGMA_DATASET`, else `./dataset.json.gz`
(`dataset-<sde_build>.json.gz` from the EX-CT/eve-sde-pipeline releases).

Errors are returned as JSON, never as a panic: `{"error":{"code","message","path"}}`
(codes: `BAD_JSON`, `BAD_REQUEST`, `UNKNOWN_TYPE`, `EFT_PARSE`, `UNKNOWN_METHOD`). Fitting problems are *not*
errors; they are listed in `violations`.
Exit codes: 0 ok · 2 calc/input error (JSON error on stdout for `calc`) · 3 dataset cannot be loaded.

Library (Rust): `eve_dogma::calc(&Dataset, &FitRequest) -> serde_json::Value`, `calc_json(&Dataset, &str) -> String`.

```

`options` omitted entirely is the same as `"options": {}`: every option takes its default, so **`validate` defaults to
true** either way (violations are reported unless `validate: false` is given).

## Semantics (precise definitions, revisions 1.4.2–1.4.4)

**`capacitor.use_gj_s` / `injected_gj_s` / `delta_gj_s`** (GJ/s, averages, not the simulation):
- `use_gj_s` = Σ over the fit's own modules with state ≥ active and capacitorNeed > 0 of
  `capacitorNeed / avg_cycle_s`, plus Σ over incoming drains (projected neutralizers and enemy nosferatu, every copy)
  of `need / duration_s`.
  - `avg_cycle_s` = (cycle time + reactivation delay) / 1000; with `options.factor_reload` and a finite clip, Pyfa's
    average including one reload per clip: `((cycle + reactivation) × (shots − 1) + (cycle + reload)) / shots`
    (only when the reload is longer than the reactivation delay).
  - Incoming `need` = the source's modified amount × range factor × the target's resistance attribute (if any) ×
    `min(1, signatureRadius / energyNeutralizerSignatureResolution)` when the source has a signature resolution;
    `duration_s` = trunc(duration ms) / 1000.
- `injected_gj_s` = cap *gained* per second, as a positive number:
  - capacitor boosters: `capacitorBonus` of the loaded charge / avg cycle, always reload-inclusive (Pyfa `forceReload`);
  - the fit's own nosferatu: `powerTransferAmount` / avg cycle, counted as income unless `options.nos_no_target_cap`;
  - incoming remote capacitor transmitters: their amount / duration.
- `delta_gj_s = peak_recharge_gj_s + injected_gj_s − use_gj_s`. `stable` / `stable_percent` / `depletes_in_s` come
  from the cap simulation, not from these averages. Drones and fighters never use cap.

**`projected[].amount`** = number of identical, independent sources (default 1):
- `kind: module` / `fighter`: `amount` copies of the module / squadron. For `drone`, there are `amount × quantity` drones.
- `kind: fit`: the source fit is computed **once on its own** (its skills, implants, boosters, fleet; its own
  `projected` list is ignored). Then each of the following is projected `amount` times, all at the entry's `distance_m`:
  - every module with state ≥ active,
  - every active drone (its `active` count),
  - every active fighter squadron.

  Each projected item is frozen with the source-modified attribute values.
- Every copy is a separate modifier: stacking penalties apply across all copies and sources. Remote reps, drains and
  ECM strengths are added per copy. This matches Pyfa's projected amount for modules, drones and fits.

**Fleet buffs** (`fleet.buffs` vs `fleet.booster_fits` vs the fit's own command bursts):
- For each warfare buff id, the candidates are the fit's own active bursts and every active burst on each booster
  fit. Booster fits are computed on their own, without their own booster fits. The single strongest candidate by
  |value| applies (Pyfa).
- **An explicit `fleet.buffs` entry overrides both completely for its buff id.** Bursts and booster fits are ignored
  for that id. Several explicit entries with the same id aggregate to one value: the minimum for buffs whose aggregate
  mode is Minimum, the maximum otherwise. Ids without an explicit entry keep the strongest-candidate rule.
- Environment beacons in `environment.effect_type_ids` whose type carries an abyssal weather (`weather_*`) or AoE
  cloud (`aoe_beacon_*`) effect are candidates too: their `warfareBuff1/2ID` / `Value` join the same per-id
  strongest-|value| pool (the dataset lists them in `environment.effect_beacons[*].dbuffs`). As in Pyfa, buffs
  79, 90, 93–99 also apply to drones that require the Drones skill, and the weather resistance / HP / velocity buffs
  (90, 93–96, 98, 99) are not stacking-penalised.

**Environment system effects without modifiers** (revision 1.4.3): incursion beacons (`OffensiveDefensiveReduction`:
Sansha / Drifter incursion system effects) apply, unpenalised, `systemEffectDamageReduction` (PostPercent) to missile
charges' damage, Smart Bomb damage, turret and drone `damageMultiplier`, and the beacon's armor/shield
`<type>DamageResistanceBonus` to the ship's armor/shield resonances.

**Burst projectors** (`projected[]` modules, revision 1.4.3): the AoE burst projectors (`doomsdayAOE*`, incl. Standup
versions) apply at full strength regardless of `distance_m` (no range factor), are blocked by the target's
`disallowOffensiveModifiers`, and are stacking-penalised. Web / paint / damp / weapon-disruption bursts modify the
target like the single-target modules; the neutralization burst adds a drain (`energyNeutralizerAmount` every
`duration`, × resistance) to the capacitor figures; the ECM burst adds a jam source (`scan<Type>StrengthBonus` ×
resistance) to the jam chance; the warp-disruption burst has no stat effect. The Standup Weapon Disruptor uses the
range factor (maxRange / falloffEffectiveness).

**Breacher pods** (revision 1.4.4): a launcher loaded with a breacher pod (charge effect `dotMissileLaunching`) deals
damage over time, `dotMaxDamagePerTick` every second for floor(`dotDuration` / 1 s) ticks. Its `offense.weapons[]`
entry has `kind: "breacher"` and `volley` = `dps` = one tick, reported as `pure` damage (no damage type, resistance
independent: counted fully in `total` and `vs_target_profile`). In the fit totals only the strongest pod counts
(Pyfa `DmgTypes.pure` keeps the max per tick), so two identical pods give the same `weapon_dps` as one. The `pure`
key is optional and may be omitted when it is 0; the scorer reads an absent `pure` as 0.

**Overheat order** (revision 1.4.4): Pyfa applies effects module by module in `modules[]` order, so an overheat
effect reads its module's `overload*` attribute (e.g. `overloadHardeningBonus`) before modules listed later in the
list have applied their modifiers. Example: a Tengu with its Defensive subsystem listed after an overheated shield
hardener gets the hardener's base overload bonus; with the subsystem listed first it gets the boosted one.

**Module state correction** (revision 1.4.5, bench 1.10.0; coordinator ruling 2026-10-03 11:19 CST, reverses the
earlier "unusable state keeps requested value" ruling; principle: align with Pyfa). For each entry of `modules[]`:
- `rig` and `subsystem` modules are always `online` unless requested `offline` (no warning).
- A requested `active` or `overheated` state the module cannot use is **corrected to `online`**, exactly like the Pyfa
  oracle (`mod.state = st if mod.isValidState(st) else ONLINE`): `active` needs an activatable effect (Pyfa effect
  category active/target) and `activationBlocked` ≤ 0; `overheated` additionally needs an overload effect. So an
  `overheated` module with no overload effect (e.g. Bastion Module, doomsdays) becomes `online`, not `active`.
- The module then gets exactly the effects of the corrected state. The response reports the **corrected** state in
  `modules[N].state`.
- Each correction emits one entry in `warnings[]`, in request order, with the exact text
  `/modules/N: state '<requested>' not possible for this module, using online` (N = index in the request's
  `modules[]`, `<requested>` = `active` | `overheated`).
- Projected modules (`projected[kind=module]` and modules inside projected / booster fits) follow the same correction;
  warnings for them are optional.

## Search (`search` RPC / CLI), interim

Not part of dogma scoring; the formal spec is deferred to the MCP round. Interim behaviour:
- params `{query, limit?, kinds?}`; `limit` defaults to **20**; `kinds` optionally restricts the categories below.
- Only published types of these kinds: `ship` (cat 6), `module` (7), `charge` (8), `drone` (18), `fighter` (87),
  `implant` / `booster` (20; booster = group name contains "Booster"), `subsystem` (32), `skill` (16).
- Case-insensitive match on the English or Chinese name. Ranking: **exact > prefix > substring**, ties by **typeID
  ascending**. Each result: `{type_id, name, name_zh, group, category_id, kind, slot, meta_level, match: "exact"|"prefix"|"substring"}`.

## EFT export (`eft_export`)

Byte-identical to Pyfa's `service/port/eft.py exportEft` with all options on (implants, boosters, cargo, loaded
charges, mutations), for the fit as Pyfa's GUI holds it (after `fill()`):
- `[Ship, Name]`, a blank line, then sections separated by **two** blank lines; no trailing newline.
- Modules: racks in the order low, med, high, rig, subsystem, service, separated by one blank line; within a rack the
  request order, then `[Empty Low|Med|High|Rig|Subsystem|Service slot]` for every free slot (totals after
  modifiers); `Module, Charge`, then ` /offline`, then ` [N]` for mutated items (base item name is written).
- Drones (`Name xN`, Pyfa DRONE_ORDER by market group, unmutated before mutated, then name) and fighters (`Name xN`,
  light/heavy/support order, N capped at squadron size) form one section, separated by one blank line.
- Implants (by implant slot) and boosters (by booster slot) form one section, separated by one blank line.
- Cargo `Name xN` sorted by (category name, group name, type name).
- Mutation details: `[N] Base`, `  Mutaplasmid`, `  attr value, …` (attribute names sorted, Pyfa `floatUnerr`
  values in Python float repr, e.g. `30.0`).
- **T3D mode (coordinator ruling 2026-10-03 06:14 CST):** follow Pyfa's actual exporter: `eft_export` writes **no**
  mode line (the earlier ruling text "incl. T3D mode line" is superseded). `eft_parse` still accepts a mode line, and
  a missing mode defaults to the first mode. Verified against Pyfa on all bench fits (tests/eft_export_parity.rs).

## FitStats (top level)

Conventions matching Pyfa (deliberate): volley is spooled; local nosferatu is cap income; missiles use the pilot's
`missileDamageMultiplier`; fighters use Pyfa's default abilities; system security defaults to nullsec.

## Draft 1.10: stats-ext (proposed fields, scored only by `ext/`, not by run.py)

Proposed for docs/20 P0-3 / P0-4. Shapes may still change before they enter a revision; `ext/` scores them against
Pyfa so an engine can implement them against fixed numbers. All optional (absent = not implemented).

- `mining` {modules_m3_s, drones_m3_s, total_m3_s, modules_drain_m3_s, drones_drain_m3_s}: ore/ice/gas yield per
  second of active mining modules and mining drones; `*_drain_*` = volume removed from the asteroid incl. residue
  (Pyfa `minerYield`, `droneYield`, `minerDrain`, `droneDrain`).
- `outgoing` {current, spool_min, spool_max} each {shield_per_s, armor_per_s, hull_per_s, capacitor_per_s}: remote
  repair HP/s and capacitor transfer GJ/s of active modules and drones (Pyfa `getRemoteReps`; current = request /
  default spool, min/max = spool 0 / 1).
- `drones.items[]` / `fighters.items[]` {drone_index | fighter_index, hp{shield,armor,hull}, ehp{shield,armor,hull},
  shield_peak_recharge_hp_s}: per drone type entry (one drone, not × quantity); ehp uses the request damage pattern
  (Pyfa drone/fighter `hp`, `ehp`, `calculateShieldRecharge`).
- `bombing` {em, thermal, kinetic, explosive} each {covert_ops_0 … covert_ops_5}: bombs of that type needed to
  kill this fit (Pyfa bombing panel: Electron / Scorch / Concussion / Shrapnel bomb, damage × (1 + 0.05 × Covert Ops
  level) × red giant `smartbombDamageMultiplier` × min(1, sig / bomb sig), result ceil to 0.1).
- `modules[].heat` {burn_cycles, burnout_s} for overheated modules (Pyfa heat column `Thermodynamics`).
- `options.include_attributes` also returns `attributes.fighters[]` {fighter_index, attributes} (scored by `effects/`
  as a separate count).

## Draft 1.11: overrides semantics (follow Pyfa; scored by `ext/`, not by run.py)

`overrides: [{type_id, attribute_id, value}]` replaces a type's **base** attribute value before any modifier is
applied, the way Pyfa's Attribute Overrides do (`eos/saveddata/override.py`, read by `ModifiedAttributeDict` when
overrides are on). The oracle applies them through that mechanism (`oracle/pyfa_oracle.py` `apply_overrides`), so
`ext/cases/ovr_*` are Pyfa-backed. Rules (Pyfa):

1. Per type, for every item of that type: ship, T3D mode, modules, charges, drones, fighters, implants, boosters,
   environment effects, projected modules / drones.
2. **Global for the whole request**: top-level overrides also reach `projected[kind=fit]` fits and
   `fleet.booster_fits` (Pyfa has one override table, not one per fit). Case `ovr_projected_fit_global`,
   `ovr_booster_fit_charge`.
3. **A mutated attribute's rolled value wins over an override** of the same attribute (Pyfa `getOriginal` reads
   mutators after overrides); the mutated item's other attributes, including those inherited from the base type,
   are overridable. Cases `ovr_mutated_rolled_attr`, `ovr_mutated_other_attr`.
4. The last entry for the same (type, attribute) wins (`ovr_duplicate_last_wins`).
5. The result is a base value: skills, modules, stacking penalties and fleet buffs then apply as usual
   (`ovr_rifter_*_skills5`, `ovr_module_resist_stacking`).

Beyond Pyfa (our contract supports it, Pyfa cannot express it): hand-derived unit tests in `ext/unit/`
(feature `overrides-unit`, each with a `derivation`), not compared to Pyfa:

- **Skill types**: an override of a skill's attribute (e.g. Navigation `velocityBonus`) applies. Pyfa ignores it
  (`Skill.getModifiedItemAttr` reads the raw type attributes). `unit_ovr_skill_attribute`.
- **Attributes the type does not have**: the override adds that base value. Pyfa ignores it (`Item.overrides`
  only loads overrides for the type's own attributes; for a mutated item, base + mutated type attributes).
  `unit_ovr_attr_not_on_type`.
- **`overrides` inside a nested FitRequest** (`projected[kind=fit].fit`, `fleet.booster_fits[]`): apply to that
  fit (and what it projects). Pyfa has no per-fit overrides. `unit_ovr_nested_projected_fit` (+ `_control`).
- The six 1.10 hand-derived cases are kept as `unit_ovr_*` (Pyfa agrees with all six).

Known engine gap (F 4b8f5f9, informational): F applies top-level overrides to its own fit only (rule 2) and lets an
override beat a rolled mutation (rule 3).

## Draft 1.11: vs_target_profile, probe_size, validity (scored by `ext/`, not by run.py)

Existing FitStats fields, now scored against Pyfa (oracle `ORACLE_EXTRA=profile,validity`):

- `offense.vs_target_profile` {dps, volley}: total weapon + drone + fighter damage with each type × (1 − the
  request `target_profile` resist, 0..1), pure (breacher) damage unchanged. Resists only, no signature / velocity
  application (Pyfa sets `DmgTypes.profile = fit.targetProfile`). Cases `tp_*`.
- `targeting.probe_size`: ship signatureRadius / strongest sensor strength, at least 1.08; null when the sensor
  strength is 0 (Pyfa `fit.probeSize`). Cases `probe_*`.
- `violations[]`: scored as the **set of distinct codes**, which must equal Pyfa's checks mapped as follows:
  `cpuUsed / pgUsed / calibrationUsed / droneBandwidthUsed` > ship total → CPU_OVERLOAD / POWER_OVERLOAD /
  CALIBRATION_OVERLOAD / DRONE_BANDWIDTH; `getSlotsFree(slot) < 0` → SLOTS_EXCEEDED; turret / launcher hardpoints
  free < 0 → TURRET_HARDPOINTS / LAUNCHER_HARDPOINTS; `fit.canFit` (canFitShipGroup*/canFitShipType*/fitsToShipType)
  **or a capital-size module on a sub-capital hull** → SHIP_RESTRICTION; rigSize ≠ ship rigSize → RIG_SIZE; raw
  maxGroupFitted → MAX_GROUP_FITTED; `canHaveState` → MAX_GROUP_ONLINE / MAX_GROUP_ACTIVE; `isValidCharge` volume >
  capacity / chargeSize / chargeGroup1–4 → CHARGE_CAPACITY / CHARGE_SIZE / CHARGE_GROUP (each checked on its own);
  `checkRequirements` → MISSING_SKILL. A fit with violations is still computed in full ("Disable Fitting
  Restrictions", ENG-VAL-005): the `val_*` cases also score every bench metric. Cases `val_*`.
- Draft (reported, not part of pass): per-module codes carry the `module_index` of **every** module that breaks
  the rule (Pyfa flags all modules of an over-limit group, not just the ones past the limit); SLOTS_EXCEEDED may
  carry `slot`; MISSING_SKILL is one entry per missing skill with `skill_type_id` and `level`, following Pyfa
  (rigs skipped, prerequisites of a missing skill included, charges of fighters skipped).
- Hand-derived, `ext/unit/` (Pyfa has no equivalent): `options.validate: false` → no violations
  (`unit_val_validate_false`); MAX_TYPE_FITTED (Pyfa has no maxTypeFitted check, `unit_val_max_type_fitted`).

## Draft 1.11: missing-f request / response fields and lookups (scored by `ext/`, not by run.py)

Pyfa-backed cases for docs/19 items whose f status is `missing` (no engine implements these yet). Oracle opt-in
`ORACLE_EXTRA=drafts` (request fields) and `sources` (attribute sources); the default oracle output is unchanged.

- `options.include_attributes: "all"` → `attributes.ship.breacherPodDamageResistance` (Breach Control,
  Pyfa `moduleBonusBreacherPodDamageControl`; 1.0 when not active). Cases `brdc_*` (ENG-MISC-004).
- `character.implants: [type_id]` + `options.implant_source: "character" | "fit"` (default "fit"): with
  "character" the character's implants apply and the fit's `implants` are ignored (Pyfa `ImplantLocation`).
  Cases `cimp_*` (ENG-IMP-002, CHR-006).
- `character.alpha_clone: true`: Alpha clone skill caps (Pyfa `alphaCloneID` 1, eve.db `alphaCloneSkills`).
  Cases `alpha_*` (ENG-CORE-009).
- `damage_pattern: {"builtin": <name>}` / `target_profile: {"builtin": <name>}`: Pyfa builtin pattern / profile by
  its raw name (`DamagePattern.getBuiltinList`, `TargetProfile.getBuiltinList`, e.g. "[NPC][Asteroid]Guristas").
  Cases `dpb_*` (PRF-DMG-001, EHP metrics) and `tpb_*` (PRF-TGT-001, `offense.vs_target_profile`).
- `options.sources: true` → `sources[target][attr]` = sorted `"<source>:<type_id>:<operator>"` of the applied
  modifiers (Pyfa "Affected by" = `ModifiedAttributeDict.getAfflictions`, used entries only); target `ship`,
  `modules.<i>`, `drones.<i>`; source `ship`, `mode`, `modules.<i>`, `drones.<i>`, `fighters.<i>` or the Pyfa class
  name (`skill`, `implant`, `booster`, ...); operator = Pyfa `Operator` name (`MULTIPLY`, `INCREASE`, `PREASSIGN`,
  ...). `dependants[source]` = sorted `"<target>/<attr>"` (the inverse; non-fit sources keyed `<class>.<type_id>`).
  Cases `src_*` (ENG-CORE-007), `dep_*` (ENG-CORE-008).
- Lookups, `ext/rpc/` (JSON-RPC methods on `serve-stdio`, Pyfa service layer via `oracle/pyfa_lookup.py`, scorer
  `ext/tools/score_rpc.py`): `item.variations {type_id}` → `{type_ids}` (ENG-MOD-013); `item.compare {type_id,
  attributes}` → `{items: [{type_id, attributes}]}` base values of every variation (MKT-004); `market.group
  {market_group_id | null}` → `{groups, items}` (null = roots; MKT-001); `market.search {query, filter}` →
  `{type_ids}` with Pyfa jargon / `re:` regex / `*` wildcards (MKT-002); `implant_sets.list` → `{sets: {set:
  {grade: [type_ids]}}}` (ENG-IMP-005); `character.import_evemon {xml}` → `{name, security_status, skills}` or an
  error for a non-EVEMon root (CHR-004); `names.resolve {names}` → `{resolved: {name: type_id | null}}` incl. Pyfa's

## Changelog
- v1 (2026-10-03): initial contract.
- v1.1 (2026-10-03): `fleet.booster_fits` implemented (oracle-verified). `projected[kind=fit]` and charges on
  projected modules are still unimplemented (warning only). Non-breaking.
- v1.2 (2026-10-03): `projected[kind=fit]` implemented; charges on projected modules applied (scripts, Nanite Repair
  Paste); incoming remote shield/armor/hull reps add to `defense.tank.raw.*` with Pyfa's diminishing-returns formula;
  incoming neuts/nos/cap transfers are extra capacitor-simulation drains (Pyfa `addDrain`, incl. signature-resolution
  scaling and resistance). Non-breaking (additive). All oracle-verified.
- v1.3 (2026-10-03): `offense.weapons[].range_m` for missiles now follows Pyfa `missileMaxRangeData` (ship-radius
  flight-time bonus, acceleration, floor/ceil blend, FoF limit, centre-to-surface) instead of velocity × flight time.
  Semantic change of one field (not a shape change). Turret optimal/falloff/tracking and missile range/explosion
  radius/velocity are now oracle-verified per weapon (selector pointers `/offense/weapons[module_index=N]/field`).
- v1.4 (2026-10-03): `defense.tank.sustained{,_effective}` (Pyfa `sustainableTank`: when the cap is unstable or reload
  is factored, local cap-using repairers run only as far as peak recharge + injected cap allow). `capacitor.use_gj_s`
  / `injected_gj_s` now include incoming drains/fills, and capacitor boosters' average cycle always includes reload
  (Pyfa `forceReload`). Additive / semantic refinement.
- v1.5 (2026-10-03): `projected[kind=fighter]` (`fighter`: FighterReq; web / warp disruption / neut / ECM abilities,
  Pyfa default abilities unless `abilities` given; projected fits also project their fighters).
  `targeting.jam_chance_percent` (Pyfa jamChance: ECM modules, drones, bursts, fighters vs strongest sensor type).
  `offense.drones[]` gains optimal_m, falloff_m, tracking, max_velocity, signature_radius; `offense.fighters[]` gains
  max_velocity, signature_radius; local fighter MWD / afterburner / evasive maneuvers abilities are applied.
  Booster side effects (`boosters[].side_effects`) oracle-verified. Additive.
- v1.4.1 (2026-10-03 05:30 CST, coordinator rulings; revision label as issued, applies on top of v1.5):
  (1) a calc error exits 2 and still prints the `{"error":…}` JSON on stdout (text fixed; behaviour unchanged);
  (2) `options` missing entirely → `validate` defaults to true (engine fixed: it used to default to false);
  (3) search is out of dogma scope; interim spec above (limit 20, kinds, exact > prefix > substring, typeID ties);
  (4) `eft_export` matches Pyfa's exporter byte for byte (section/blank-line layout, empty-slot lines, ` /offline`
  lowercase, drone/fighter/implant/booster/cargo ordering, mutation block; no T3D mode line because Pyfa writes none);
  (5) duplicate changelog heading removed. Engine speed work (skill pruning, modifier target index) changes no output.
  Ruling 2026-10-03 06:14 CST: the T3D mode line follows Pyfa's actual exporter (none); wording in "EFT export" updated
  (text only, no revision bump, bench frozen at 1.8.0).
- v1.4.2 (2026-10-03 05:45 CST): precise definitions of `capacitor.use_gj_s` / `injected_gj_s` / `delta_gj_s`,
  `projected[].amount` (incl. projected fits: computed once, every active module/drone/fighter projected `amount` times,
  each copy a separate penalised modifier), and fleet-buff precedence (explicit `fleet.buffs` override own bursts and
  booster fits per buff id), see "Semantics". Engine: projected Tracking Disruptors and Guidance Disruptors (Pyfa
  Effect6424 / Effect6423: target's Gunnery modules / Missile Launcher Operation charges, range factor, resistance) are
  now applied (they were a warning before). Oracle-verified, incl. new amount>1 projected-fit cases.
- v1.4.4 (bench 1.9.0, released 2026-10-03 11:00 CST): additive `pure` key in offense
  `dps`/`volley` objects and `weapons[].kind = "breacher"`; "Semantics" defines breacher pods and overheat order.
- v1.4.3 (2026-10-03 06:05 CST): no request/response field changes. "Semantics" now also defines abyssal weather /
  AoE cloud environment beacons (warfare buffs in the fleet-buff pool, drone scope, penalties), incursion system
  effects and burst projectors (full strength, no range factor). Doomsday / lance DPS = subcycles × volley / cycle
  (Pyfa `getVolleyParameters`). `cpu_used` / `pg_used` round like Python `round(v, 2)`. Oracle-verified (bench 1.8.0).
- v1.4.5 (bench 1.10.0, released 2026-10-03; applies on top of 1.4.4): module state correction (see "Semantics"):
  an impossible requested `active`/`overheated` state is corrected to `online`, `modules[].state` reports the
  corrected state, and a `warnings[]` entry `/modules/N: state '<requested>' not possible for this module, using online`
  is emitted. Reverses the 2026-10-03 ruling that kept the requested value. Values are unchanged for every scored case
  (the Pyfa oracle already corrects the state); only `modules[].state` / `warnings[]` change for engines that echoed it.
